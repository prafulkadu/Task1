# Task1

Write a C# class to execute a number of pieces of work (actions) in the background (i.e.
without blocking the program’s execution).
• The actions must be executed sequentially – one at a time
• The actions must be executed in the order that they were added to the class
• The actions are not necessarily added all at the same time
• The actions are not necessarily all executed on the same thread
